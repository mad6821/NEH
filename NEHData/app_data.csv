could become exemplars of resistance—most consequentially in 1917 in Houston,
Texas. A rebellion of Black soldiers against police brutality there led to the
largest murder trial in US history and nineteen executions, hastening
relegation of the four Black regiments to menial, peripheral tasks. The rise

After the failed divorce suit, Susan sued her husband for additional financial support to care for a child she had while committed to the South Carolina Lunatic Asylum.

It also directly influenced the Catholic Church’s position on fetal ensoulment, as articulated in Pius IX’s 1869 Apostolicae Sedis. With this text, Cangiamila became one of the first theologians—and certainly the most vocal of his time—to insist that fetal ensoulment might occur as early as conception. We expect that the volume will attract readers and researchers from numerous fields, given the work’s significance to Roman Catholic theology, gendered scientific practice, and social and legal debates about unborn life.",Preparation for publication of a translation and critical edition of Francesco Emanuele Cangiamila’s <em>Embriología Sacra</em> (1751).

To disrupt and destroy Jim Crow in Gotham City, black activists built a new organization, the Legal Rights Association, that pioneered the art and science of protesting in public and developed strategies of civil disobedience—public set-pieces, boycotts, petitions, defense funds, etc.—that have become the hallmarks of grassroots anti-racism protests ever since.","Research for a book on the desegregation of mass transit

In 1776, all kinds of people around the world, not just the men who declared independence, sought the end of oppression, asserting rights to life, liberty, and happiness. This Revolution was more contested, protracted, and diverse, with a wider cast of characters than is usually assumed. The engines of change for what happened in the classic thirteen colonies frequently lay outside those colonies.  Piecing together a number of unexpected locations and unheralded “founders,” this book tells the story of the American Revolution in a surprising and novel way.  This history, from 1763 to 1788, clarifies the Revolution’s origins, trajectory, ideas, and action. It reveals a rich past we the people really need in our current disunited states of America.

Our solution proposes a workflow that integrates GIS, CAD, and the Unity game engine to build a malleable mapping environment that forgoes the concept of historical layers in favor of linked views that allow simultaneous navigation among original sources, modern cartography, and virtual landscapes.

At the height of Ireland’s Great Famine, colonial officials advocated for assisted migration projects as a remedy for both the island’s catastrophic situation and the labor shortage plaguing Britain’s other colonies; young women from Ireland’s workhouses accounted for the majority of these emigrants. At the local level, however, commissioners frequently struggled to implement the plans, as some women refused to participate and colonial officials deemed others unfit. By exploring state-assisted female migration within an imperial context, this project highlights both the construction of power relations crucial to imperial control and also the role of Irish women in Britain’s imperial project.","Research and writing leading to a book&nbsp;on Irish female migration to Canada, Australia, and South Africa in&nbsp;the nineteenth-century.&nbsp;",British History,0,NA,1,Jill Bender [Project Director],3,British History; Immigration History; Women's History

The period is often seen as one in which their Christian kingdom gained the upper hand over the weaker Islamic states of al-Andalus. Historians have generally believed that Fernando aspired to imperial authority in Iberia, developed a close relationship with the French monastic order of Cluny, and exerted dominance over the Islamic states to the south. This project challenges all these presumptions. Through an original analysis of royal charters and narrative sources, it traces the pragmatic nature of power and a geopolitical environment in which religious identity was by no means paramount.","Research and writing

Only after slavery was abolished did the Supreme Court rule unequivocally that immigration was a federal matter. By this time, the Chinese were subject to the kinds of racial practices that had been used against free blacks in the antebellum era. To justify Chinese exclusion, the Supreme Court ruled in 1889 that federal authority over immigration resided in the inherent sovereignty of the nation, rather than any particular part of the Constitution.

On both fronts, a similar claim is made: namely, that liberal democratic political theory has failed to recognize that human beings are primarily “rationalizing” beings, rather than “reasoning” beings. I believe that political theorists need to take this claim seriously, so that we can consider with fresh eyes the question: to what extent are genuinely “rational” citizens required in order to have a properly functioning liberal democracy?","Writing two to three chapters of a book about the kind of reasoning

Through ethnography and archival research, the project focuses on two Northeastern villages. A stream of migrants came back to these villages during the boom years, turning down the rising urban wages and returning to live below the poverty level as subsistence farmers. Why did these migrants move away from growth? Their exodus illuminates a core dilemma for development: people can experience growth as a loss of freedom. The manuscript pays attention to migrants as they debate the importance of growth in their lives. I consider their phone calls home, their bus rides back, the money they remit, and the houses they build. Return from the World thus strives to understand growth through the stories told by those who leave it behind. In so doing, the manuscript builds an argument about the limits and possibilities of contemporary economic freedom.","Research and writing of a chapter for a book on

Based on 12 months of ethnographic research, this project will examine one school that has, paradoxically, long struggled against its own school system in seeking culturally relevant education, rejecting the national intercultural bilingual curriculum and those who make it. It shows how teachers who aim to revolutionize what and how they teach find a challenge at the intersections of knowledge, power, and culture in claims to expertise.","Ethnographic fieldwork in a school in Quito, Ecuador, preparing for a book on how teachers use their expertise to advocate for their students.

Born after the 1970s’ collapse of a male-breadwinner norm, the “working family” is the product of immense cultural effort. In the 1980s and 1990s, academics, politicians, journalists, and activists constructed two versions of the model working family. Whereas mainstream conservatives argued that mothers had to “choose” how to manage work and family, liberals called for employers and society to collectively meet working parents’ needs. In both versions, the norm excluded some families—most significantly poor, single Black mothers. The working-family ideal also faced opposition as both hardcore conservatives and feminists led efforts to unseat it. This study traces the working-family norm’s rise to hegemony in law and culture, showing how it structured debates about a post-Fordist workforce, family leave, welfare reform, and mothers’ “choices” about work and family.","Writing a book on the emergence and impact of

During the 1790s and beyond, medicine left the somber halls of universities and hospitals to become profoundly politicized, inspiring a whole panoply of subcultures.

The theorist Paul Gilroy uses the image of “ships in motion across the spaces between Europe, America, Africa, and the Caribbean” as an organizing symbol for the black Atlantic. For my book, it is the haunted house that serves as a central motif in this cultural and geographic setting. I argue that this symbol can also be traced and traversed across time, space, genre, and medium, from slave narratives and early travel writing to contemporary literature, cinema, and popular culture. There are no monographs that illuminate this pattern of haunted houses in the black Atlantic.

Contemporaries disagreed about the effect this interlude had on the realism of his work, and art historians continue to debate how his empirical approach influenced his style and technique. The project team will use computer vision to seek formal details that art historians may have overlooked or been unable to discern. We will also use machine learning to discover whether there are formal features that contribute to the verisimilitude of three different types of pictorial realism: Constable’s paintings of clouds, fine art photographs of clouds, and research photographs of clouds made for scientific study.","The development of computational methods to analyze formal details in paintings, focusing on cloud studies by John Constable and his emulators, documentary photographs, and fine art photographs.&nbsp;&nbsp;",Art History and Criticism,0,NA,2,Elizabeth Mansfield [Project Director]; James Wang [Co Project Director],1,Art History and Criticism

Weaving together historical case studies, ethnographic interviews with literary agents, and large-scale data analysis, Literary Agents and American Literature shows how agents have shaped the literary field.

I focus on the shifting value and meaning of art and literature when they crossed boundaries between world zones, either through official exchange via cultural diplomacy and exports, or through unofficial and illegal channels via smuggling, Voice of America broadcasts, etc. Take a single case: Andrey Sinyavsky’s absurdist works, written in the 1950s, were perceived in the USSR as oppositional, and were therefore unpublishable and of no official economic value. Smuggled to the west, they were perceived as expressions of political and aesthetic freedom and published to acclaim, bringing high returns. My book presents a historical and theoretical explanation of how such cases of exchange constituted and reinforced the aesthetic systems of distinct world zones of the late twentieth century.","Research

I argue that unlike WWI and COVID-19, the 1918 flu did not serve as a mirror for Europeans’ collective aspirations and failures, so they did not remember it as a collective event, despite its extensive and collective effects on society. This thesis explains why the pandemic is undertheorized in the academic record and overlooked in the public memory but is essential for contextualizing COVID-19.","Research and writing leading to a book on the 1918 influenza epidemic in rural Europe, that investigates the social, political, and religious factors shaping responses to the medical crisis.",European History,0,NA,1,John Eicher [Project Director],3,"Cultural History; European History; History and Philosophy of Science, Technology, and Medicine"

But they disguised that warfare within a mythology of colonial genesis, rewriting histories of conquest and settlement, codifying justificatory categories such as slavery and rebellion, even imagining foundational events.  As a result of this multifaceted process, European colonizers invented, as much as they enacted, colonial settlement and rule.  Built on fifteen years of archival research in seven countries, this book seeks to contrast colonialist mythistory with an evidence-based, comparative analysis of African, Maya, Miskitu, and European experiences.

The poems also convey a sense of longing for a shared heritage and homeland, a desire for belonging within the present, and a forceful commitment to anti-racist discourse.

Exiles, vagrants, and bandits were all united by poverty and class: the application of exile was a regressive punishment, primarily used against the lower classes, and one that was experienced wildly differently by those with means versus those without. In this way, I also argue for a reconsideration of the ways in which we think about the creation of poverty in the early modern world, and particularly through the application of labels by the justice system. Though my project focuses on early modern Spain, my project should also speak to scholars working on banditry and crime in other areas like Italy, Germany, and China.","Research and writing leading to a book on exile as a criminal punishment in early modern Spain with economic, social, religious, and political repercussions.",European History,0,NA,1,Amanda Scott [Project Director],2,European History; Renaissance History

Though Bond achieved atypical success in a dominantly white profession, he was often marginalized and much of his work remains overlooked.

Outcomes depend largely on interactions with host states. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach that bridges comparative law, law and society, and anthropology, the book takes a view that balances difference with commonality in juxtaposing China’s developmentalism with those of Anglo-American legal empires.

Yet, it was not enforced until 1899 when the first public guillotine execution took place in Saint-Louis, the colony’s administrative capital, thus setting in motion the machinery of death. This book investigates the history of capital punishment in Senegal from the 1820s to the 1960s by exploring the role it played to mete out punishment and to maintain law and order. It also analyses its role in citizenship building to unlock the multiple and complex determinants in its practice. Its main objective is to analyze the evolution of capital punishment and its impact on the development of the colonial state by highlighting the construction of death sentences and what it reveals about the French’s concerns with citizenship building. The book will contribute to the scholarship on colonialism and punishment in colonial Africa and enhance the global debates about capital punishment.",Research and writing leading to a book on the history of capital punishment in Colonial Senegal between the 1820s and the 1960s.,African History,0,NA,1,Dior Konate [Project Director],3,African History; African Studies; Legal History

At a time when the state advocated a racially motivated fiction of linguistic purity to consolidate an Iranian (Aryan) identity, this deviation from the poetic norms challenged the hegemony of Persian as a national language. It also produced a transnational network between Iranian poets and internationalist poets such as Langston Hughes. Drawing on archival research in Iran and France, I then argue that this critique of identity transformed the language of Iranian cinema primarily through the works of the poet-filmmakers Férydoun Rahnéma and Forugh Farrokhzad in the 1960s.","Writing of a book on how authors

Drawing from nearly 3,000 sources, my research documents the myriad ways that Euro-Americans, Native Americans, and African Americans have related to this charismatic reptile over the past two centuries: not only as a terrifying predator, but also a landscape symbol, commodity, trophy, mascot, pet, totem, endangered species, nuisance, and sentinel species. I show how humans have shaped this apex predator, even as culture strongly inflects how we perceive it. When we peer into the eyes of an alligator, what we see reflected back is as much a product of our preconceptions and fears as the unvarnished reality of the creature that stands before us.",Writing leading to a book on the environmental and cultural history of the American alligator.,U.S. History,0,NA,1,Mark Barrow [Project Director],3,Cultural History; History of Science; U.S. History

We propose to interlink these records to social, professional, political, and family networks of those interred in these sepulchers over successive generations; substantially expand the dataset already curated; design and build an interactive interface enabling access to this rich material from several scholarly perspectives; and create methods to visualize spatial and social relationships. The creation and re-use of these omnipresent tombs are untapped sources to investigate and contextualize religious beliefs, power struggles, economic growth, and cultural products of the late middle ages and Renaissance.","The development and implementation of a public interface for research into medieval and early modern burial and commemoration through&nbsp;Digital&nbsp;Sepoltuario: Scholarly Access and Search (DSsas),&nbsp;a database and platform documenting the tombs of Renaissance Florence.",Renaissance History,0,NA,2,Worthy Martin [Project Director]; Anne Leader [Co Project Director],3,Cultural History; Renaissance History; Renaissance Studies
