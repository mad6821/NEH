SSNs are generally understood as an incidental part of the larger story of modern state-building and social provision—or today, often as a risk.  But I focus squarely on the number in order to offer a material and affective history of how Americans have envisioned the modern federal government and their shifting relationship to it.  By considering what has often been seen as a regulatory, administrative, or policy matter as a humanistic one deeply entwined with questions of civic belonging, state obligation, and individual responsibility, a history of the Social Security number gives us new purchase on the dilemmas of American citizenship, past and present.","Research toward writing a history of the Social Security number, examining modern U.S. attitudes toward citizenship, governance, and civic feeling.","U.S. History",0,NA,1,"Sarah Igo [Project Director]",3,"American Studies; Intellectual History; U.S. History"

At the center of the conflict was the question of whether or not images could convey spiritual teachings in the Eastern Orthodox Christian church. The debate was settled in 843 when images were decreed equal to texts in their ability to convey religious ideas. Byzantine Iconoclasm is unique because, unlike Western Protestant-motivated iconoclasms, iconophile theology went beyond religious arguments and instead theorized the properties of texts and images. Despite Byzantine Iconoclasm’s rich insights into modality, the debate has gone largely unstudied by Western rhetoric scholars. The monograph Windows to Heaven: The Rhetorical Legacy of Byzantine Icons corrects this oversight by reframing the Iconoclasm debate as a discussion about multimodality and asking what Byzantine religious icons reveal about contemporary ways of seeing.","Research and writing of

Yet, the same South Bronx also produced one of the most powerful artistic innovations of the past 50 years: hip-hop. Urban Legends excavates the broader cultural history of the Bronx—at once more intertwined, and more outwardly influential, than these two narratives have allowed.

But after World War II, he radically changed course, investing his fame and fortune into the daring project of bringing sustainable agriculture to America. From his model farm in rural Ohio, Malabar, Bromfield sounded an early alarm about harmful pesticides and fought for an agriculture that would enrich the soil and protect the planet. Based on unpublished letters and memoirs, this book not only unearths a lost American icon, it also sheds light on the little-known origins of sustainable farming. By situating that movement in its cultural context, the book shows how organic agriculture was just as much a response to the shocks of the 20th century as the literary modernism of Bromfield’s Lost Generation peers.","Research and writing leading to publication of a biography of Pulitzer-prize

But it also produced a radical new ecology, one that reflected a parasitic and cyclical new relationship with the environment and natural resource.

By developing the “drain of wealth” theory, Naoroji rubbished claims of colonial benevolence and instead demonstrated how British rule was responsible for a spate of deadly famines that killed millions of Indians in the nineteenth century. My book will be the first comprehensive study of Naoroji’s career. It situates Naoroji as a global leader, someone with a conscious commitment towards broader emancipatory politics worldwide.

Later scholars suggested that his alliances with Christians were born from his non-Muslim genealogy. But his own cultural production demonstrates his eastward orientation, as he imported motifs and architectural techniques from Abbasid territories and minted coins in the caliph in Baghdad's name. The book traces these two, opposing trajectories: material culture that linked Islamic west to east and historiography that separated al-Andalus from the rest of the Islamic world. Like al-Andalus itself, Ibn Mardanish's story was recast in the years after the Christian conquest to make it fit into narratives of an emergent Europe.","A book-length study about Rex Lupus,

mind as they relate to music and sound perception in the Renaissance. Music
occupies a special and at times difficult position in the early modern history
of the philosophy of mind. In Greek antiquity, Plato sought to explain the
emotional hold that music has on human beings by postulating an ontological
relationship between the mathematical ratios expressing musical intervals and
the harmonic constitution of the human soul. Gregor Reisch’s <em>Margarita
Philosophica</em>, one of the textbooks adopted in German, French, and
Italian universities during the Renaissance,<em> </em>well summarizes this point: “Since everything welcomes what
is similar and rejects what is dissimilar, Plato argues that our soul is composed
of musical proportions.” However, Aristotle rejected the notion that the soul
is a harmonious musical-mathematical construct (<em>De anima</em> I, 4). Given their interest in recovering Ancient Greek culture, Renaissance&nbsp;writers&nbsp;had
to face this conceptual conflict: Is there really a structural congruence
between music and soul as Plato claimed? And if so, can such congruence be
reconciled with an Aristotelian understanding of the operations of the mind?
Ultimately, the problem was to choose or find a compromise between the Platonic
“harmonic” soul and the Aristotelean “organic” soul. Music stood at the
crossroad of this conceptual topology as a theoretically ambiguous object of
sensation and cognition.","Preparation for publication of a book about music, sound perception, and

Whether embodied in public monuments or depicted in feature films, Civil War memory circulates through cultural narratives whose generic form performs ideological functions: chivalric romance underwrites racial violence, pastoral elegy encodes agrarian ideology, and concepts of tragedy undo narratives of emancipation.

At the same time, the tremendous accounting work required to support the economies of Atlantic slavery and settler colonialism, cultivated new forms of bookkeeping and ideas about the reliability of numerical facts.

It also served a secret military function: logistics, surveillance, and espionage. As a business serving the puppet state it was touted as a mark of legitimacy.

Rather than being constantly antagonistic toward foreign imperialism, China has undergone cycles of seeking cooperation with foreigners and demonizing them. When facing severe political challenges, Chinese elites often tried to exclude domestic enemies in national identity mobilization. However, if targeting domestic others alone was politically inconvenient or unappealing, they would promote antiforeign identity to reinforce internal battles.

Realities on the ground, however, threatened such visions of empire, and repeatedly hindered German efforts in the region. The most important challenges were tied to issues of land accessibility and water scarcity. Massive investments into harbor structures, irrigation, and other imperial infrastructures soon shaped broader policies, especially following the 1904 Herero and Nama Uprising. Unintended consequences and overall failures, combined with the employment of everyday violence of the colonial state to achieve its fantasies, eventually transformed nature and people but also shaped the imperial imaginations of German colonialists.

The project is part of a book-chapter treating the spread of legal knowledge in Germany and Italy in the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries.  Using unpublished manuscripts annotated by medieval teachers, it explores legal knowledge at the regional level, to reveal tensions and reciprocity between regional interpretations and legal universalism.  It explores how judicial practices and principles, framed as commonly-held standards of equity and ethics, can be shaped by those who know law’s history, rationales, technical framework, and rhetoric.","Preparation
